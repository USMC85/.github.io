The K-Rod page for a digital forensic company I want to start.  The logo in the upper left corner uses some of the code to spin the log when the mouse rolls over it.  The menu will eventually stack into a single column for smaller screens.  The logo will pop out to the very top as the screen gets smaller.

Only the HOME and CONTACT menus work for now, the others are place holders.  The wording on the main page is partly real and partly Lorem Ipsum. Code has several comments and of there is code remarked out, I plan on revisiting it after this class.

The contact page has basic javascript to verify the format.  I plan on making another version of the contact page and linked the outline of it under the ABOUT tab.
